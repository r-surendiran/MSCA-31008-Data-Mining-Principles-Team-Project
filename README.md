**Project description**

In this project our team applied the majority of algorithms we learned in the Data Mining class with Professor U. Pamuksuz.

In our work we used **Starbucks App Customer Rewards Program dataset**, which simulated about 140000 transactions. This data allowed us to ask multiple business questions about Starbucks customers and transactions and answer them, using different techniques (below). 

Among them: 

* **Unsupervised lerning techniques** (k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)

* **Dimensionality reduction techniques** (PCA, t-SNE)

* **Supervised learning techniques** (Regression, Classification)

  + _Decision Tree_
  
  + _k-nearest neighbors_
  
  + _Support Vector Machines_
  
  + _Random Forest_
  
  + _Gradient Boosting_
  
  + _AdaBoost_
